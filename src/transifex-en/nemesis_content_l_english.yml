 CRISIS_SPECIAL_PROJECT_1: "Something Beyond Reality"
 CRISIS_SPECIAL_PROJECT_1_DESC: "A quiet mania sweeps through our population. Its origin seems intangible, but they - we - have become preoccupied with the notion that we [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] are destined for greater things. We should investigate the cause of this mass hysteria, and its whispered promises of galactic domination.\n\n$CRISIS_SPECIAL_PROJECTS_TUTORIAL$"
 crisis.4120.name: "The Great Prospect"
 crisis.4120.desc: "The investigation into the phenomenon now colloquially known as §Hthe Great Prospect§! has concluded.\n\nIt appears that there is some kind of 'hidden layer' to the universe - a mysterious parallel dimension somehow connected to this plane through neurological activity or thought patterns.\n\nThe $PHYSICS$ and $SOCIETY$ departments have jointly named this dimension §Hthe Shroud§!. The working hypothesis is that the actions and thoughts of [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] indirectly affect this alternate dimension, and that we have the potential to access its energies."
 crisis.4120.a: "Magnificent!"

 CRISIS_SPECIAL_PROJECT_MACH_1: "$CRISIS_SPECIAL_PROJECT_1$"
 CRISIS_SPECIAL_PROJECT_MACH_1_DESC: "Sensors in multiple systems across the [Root.GetName] report minuscule, but inexplicable, energy fluctuations. These power anomalies are too small to disturb our processes, but they still warrant further investigation so as to ascertain their cause.\n\n$CRISIS_SPECIAL_PROJECTS_TUTORIAL$"
 crisis.4120.mach.name: "$crisis.4120.name$"
 crisis.4120.mach.desc: "The previously reported energy fluctuations that triggered sensors across the [Root.GetName] have been analyzed.\n\nThey constitute empirical proof of a parallel dimension.\n\nOur scientific theory subroutines report that, with 96.7% certainty, the alternate dimension consists of almost pure energy.\n\nCross-referencing the xeno-archives, there are mentions of such a dimension in the records of a lost organic civilization which assigned the anomaly the ID tag: §Hthe Shroud§!.\n\nFluctuations in the Shroud appear to be connected to the physical and mental duress of organic lifeforms. Recommended action: menace arbitrary organic lifeforms to validate the Reality/Shroud connection hypothesis."
 crisis.4120.mach.a: "Confirmed."

 CRISIS_SPECIAL_PROJECT_HIVE_1: "$CRISIS_SPECIAL_PROJECT_1$"
 CRISIS_SPECIAL_PROJECT_HIVE_1_DESC: "We have sensed alien impulses within our drone networks - an undisciplined desire to grow, to become greater still. One Mind encompassing the entire galaxy. It is not of us, but its promise is too tempting to ignore. We shall give our undivided attention to finding the origin of these intrusive impulses.\n\n$CRISIS_SPECIAL_PROJECTS_TUTORIAL$"
 crisis.4120.hive.name: "$crisis.4120.name$"
 crisis.4120.hive.desc: "We have traced these stray thoughts, following the dreams of other, less united minds, and our purpose-bred drones. The impulses come from beyond the material realm, from a place powered by thought and emotion. This space has been identified as §Hthe Shroud§!, and we are certain that - just as it influences us - we in turn can influence it."

 CRISIS_SPECIAL_PROJECT_2: "The Unseen Ripples"
 CRISIS_SPECIAL_PROJECT_2_DESC: "The current theory is that the universe we know and the Shroud are linked - and that particularly disruptive events may have a 'ripple effect' translating from one dimension to the other. This theory should be put to the test.\n\n$CRISIS_SPECIAL_PROJECTS_TUTORIAL$"
 crisis.4125.name: "Well of Power"
 crisis.4125.desc: "The massive amounts of data from all the tests regarding the supposed dimensional ripple effect has finally been processed.\n\nThe results are spectacular! There is definitely a connection - and a powerful one at that. Explicit patterns have been found - how actions taken in our reality causes certain fluctuations in the Shroud - and this proves that these unseen energies can be tamed and eventually directed for all sorts of extraordinary purposes!"

 crisis.4125.hive.desc: "We have become wiser once again. A single action of ours creates turbulences in the Shroud. Even our least impressive drone may impress itself upon the dermis of the Shroud, creating strong ripples within this energy-laden dimension. We must unleash more of its power."
 crisis.4125.hive.a: "Beautiful."

 # Crisis Special Project 3 - General loc
 CRISIS_SPECIAL_PROJECT_3: "Merge Request"
 CRISIS_SPECIAL_PROJECT_3_DESC: "The strengthening of our dominion - combined with the undeniable sense of purpose that is unifying our species - has led our scientists to believe that we are already being fueled by the energies of the Shroud.\n\n$CRISIS_SPECIAL_PROJECTS_TUTORIAL$"
 crisis.4130.name: "Fuel From Another World"
 crisis.4130.desc: "There is no longer any doubt that the very act of successfully expanding our empire is infused with the strange energies of the Shroud. Energies that boost and hone both mind and matter in our reality.\n\nIf these are effects the Shroud can bestow while still separated from our reality, then imagine what godlike potential the [Root.Species.GetName] species could gain if the two dimensions were merged!"

 crisis.4130.hive.a: "There is a way."

 CRISIS_SPECIAL_PROJECT_4: "Tearing the Fabric"
 CRISIS_SPECIAL_PROJECT_4_DESC: "The time has come to find a way to unleash the energies of the Shroud, and tap into this unfathomable source of power.\n\nThe current theory is that a sufficiently large power surge could rupture the barrier between dimensions, ultimately leading to the two realities merging.\n\nThe energies of the Shroud belong to those who seize it. So let us seize it.\n\n$CRISIS_SPECIAL_PROJECTS_TUTORIAL_CLOSE$"
 crisis.4135.name: "The End Is Nigh"
 crisis.4135.desc: "This day marks the beginning of the final chapter. We now have a plan on how to tear open the barrier between worlds and let the energies of the Shroud become one with our universe, ultimately granting [From.GetName] powers beyond reckoning.\n\nUsing our own sun as the focal point, we will gather sufficient quantities of energy in this reality to power a surge that will pierce the barrier to the Shroud, effectively merging it with ours.\n\nWe need to harvest the power of multiple suns using new mobile space fortresses called §H$crisis_star_eater_plural$§!.\n\nThe only little side-effect of the sun harvest process is that the surrounding celestial bodies may suffer compromised structural integrity - and complete obliteration. But that is a small price to pay for the powers that will be ours.\n\nThe end of the beginning is upon us."

 crisis.4135.mach.desc: "Priority message.\nScientific theory subroutines have established an algorithm for how [Root.GetName] can access and harness 99.9% of the energy output of ID: 'the Shroud'.\n\nUsing the star in one of our solar systems as a nexus, operations will commence to harvest energy using a newly-developed type of technology (ID: '§H$crisis_star_eater$§!'), an offensive, mobile space fortress with the capability to siphon all the energy out of stars and redirect it to the nexus. When sufficient energy has been accrued, the nexus facility can disrupt and pierce the dimensional barrier - effectively merging this reality with ID: 'the Shroud' and allowing the [Root.GetName] full control to access and direct its energies.\n\nNote: Side-effects of utilizing $crisis_star_eater_plural$ technology include near-complete breakdown of physical material in targeted solar systems.

 crisis.4140.desc: "For a long time we [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] have known that we are meant for greater things. That our destiny was nothing less than the fate of the universe itself.\n\nOver the last couple of years this notion has grown stronger to the point that it can no longer be denied that great change is coming for [Root.GetAdj] society. In fact we stand on the precipice right now.\n\nThe galaxy may not be ready for our inevitable dominion, but the [Root.GetName] is ready for the galaxy. We will be misunderstood. We will be opposed.

 # Unlock Crisis Level 2
 crisis.4145.name: "We Are Legion"
 crisis.4145.desc: "The [Root.GetName] will not be denied. The impressive effects of our unity are undeniable. A deep-seated motivation and hunger for expansion permeates every corner of society, bringing forth astounding advances in combat capabilities and scientific leaps that we could not have anticipated.\n\nWhat chance does a galaxy full of different opinions, random resource distribution, and clashing interests have against a concord such as the will of the [Root.GetName]?!"
 crisis.4145.mach.desc: "The [Root.GetName] will not be denied.

More than the usual political mud-slinging: these amount to an §Poutright insult§!, as it appears we are the subjects of fierce ridicule amongst [scandalous_insult_country.GetAdj] society.\n\nWhether or not we pay any mind to this baseless slander: diplomacy and pride would demand that we stand our ground."
 envoy_events.100.desc.gestalt: "A delegate from the §H[scandalous_insult_country.GetName]§! has let slip their gestalt's true feelings about us, apparently when in conference with other, anonymous parties.

 MEMBER_TO_CUSTODIAN_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02: "This is unexpected. Surely there are more pressing matters for the Galactic Custodian to attend to?"
 MEMBER_TO_CUSTODIAN_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03: "We remain unconvinced that the Custodianship is truly necessary, but perhaps you will prove us wrong."
 MEMBER_TO_CUSTODIAN_HOSTILE_GREETING_01: "Enjoy your lofty position while you can, Custodian. It won't last."
 MEMBER_TO_CUSTODIAN_HOSTILE_GREETING_02: "We are still trying to piece together how exactly you managed to con the Senate into granting you those Custodian powers."
 MEMBER_TO_CUSTODIAN_HOSTILE_GREETING_03: "Since you assumed the Custodianship, a heavy darkness has been looming over the Galactic Community. We fear it is slowly being subverted into something unrecognizable."

 MEMBER_TO_CUSTODIAN_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02: "How can we best be of service to the Galactic Community, Custodian?"
 MEMBER_TO_CUSTODIAN_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03: "The Galactic Community is lucky to have you, Custodian."
 OUTSIDER_TO_CUSTODIAN_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01: "So the Galactic Community has a \"leader\" now. Interesting."
 OUTSIDER_TO_CUSTODIAN_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02: "The appointment of a Custodian does not make membership in the Galactic Community more appealing to us, but we shall see."
 OUTSIDER_TO_CUSTODIAN_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03: "So the other members of the Community are the vassals of the Custodian then? No? Apologies, but we are still struggling to understand the exact nature of this arrangement."
 OUTSIDER_TO_CUSTODIAN_HOSTILE_GREETING_01: "The Galactic Community has always been a rotten institution, and that was BEFORE the idiots in its Senate made you Custodian."
 OUTSIDER_TO_CUSTODIAN_HOSTILE_GREETING_02: "The members of the Community are bigger fools than we thought, if they offered the Custodianship to the [From.GetName]."
 OUTSIDER_TO_CUSTODIAN_HOSTILE_GREETING_03: "You [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] can't run the [From.GetName], and now you are expected to guide the entire Galactic Community? Ha!"

The demise of this officer is long overdue."
 operation.6010.6.desc: "Security is lax around a particular monument of the [target.GetRulerTitle] on [target.Capital.GetName]. Destroying this monument will prove to the galaxy that the rebel movement can strike even at the very heart of the Imperium."

With enough explosives, it should be possible to bring down the entire ISD building along with any agents inside it."
 operation.6010.8.desc: "The Imperial Armada has established recruitment centers on planets across the Galactic Imperium. At these sites, their recruiters fill the Armada's ranks with the gullible youth of the Imperium's numerous member states. These naive fools are then fed lies and conditioned to obey the [target.GetRulerTitle].\n\nDestroying one of these centers would send a powerful message that betraying your own kind and siding with the Imperium carries a steep price."

 operation.6015.3.desc: "Surveillance of the target's personal residence revealed a security flaw in the control panel used to open the front door. Our operatives rigged the panel to trigger a powerful energy discharge when used.

 operation.6015.5.desc: "The target's hunter-killer drone escort made a frontal attack impossible, so an alternate approach was required. Our operatives reprogrammed an automated orbital freighter to collide with the target drone's personal shuttle as it was leaving the busy orbital space of [target_country.Capital.GetName] for a mission elsewhere in the Imperium. The resulting explosion was powerful enough that no trace of the drone's memory core remained to be salvaged."
 operation.6015.6.desc: "With surgical precision, the network of small explosives planted by our operatives severed the supports of the monument to the [target_country.GetRulerTitle] on [target_country.Capital.GetName]. The massive statue then slowly toppled from its platform and shattered into a million pieces as it hit the ground. By the time the local authorities arrived on the scene, our operatives were already on their way to their exfiltration points."

 operation.6015.8.desc: "A network of carefully concealed explosives planted by our operatives around the Recruitment Center detonated as one when their trigger was fired. Casualties were heavy, and although the Imperial Armada is certain to find the recruits it needs elsewhere in the Imperium, this is at least a symbolic blow that will be felt by the [target_country.GetRulerTitle] for some time."
