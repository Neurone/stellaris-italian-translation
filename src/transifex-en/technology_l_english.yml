 tech_binary_motivators_desc: "These advanced motivators are both smaller and lighter than previous versions, allowing robotic units to allocate additional space for subsystems."
 tech_nanite_assemblers: "Nanite Assemblers"
 tech_nanite_assemblers_desc: "Using programmable nanites to assist in the construction of new robotic units will allow for more advanced models that are equipped with an even greater array of subsystems."
 tech_adaptive_combat_algorithms: "Adaptive Combat Algorithms"
 tech_adaptive_combat_algorithms_desc: "Organics often fight using illogical and unpredictable tactics that can be difficult to effectively counter. Adaptive tactics and new, more maneuverable warforms should provide a decisive advantage."
 tech_biomechanics: "Biomechanics"
 tech_biomechanics_desc: "Millions of years of organic evolution will sometimes, through sheer persistence, produce elegant solutions that can also be applied to machine designs."
 tech_singularity_core: "Singularity Core"
 tech_singularity_core_desc: "A captive black hole that can be studied in a controlled environment would be an incredible research asset."
 tech_micro_replicators: "Micro-Replicators"
 tech_micro_replicators_desc: "Microscopic tools that can assist our replication units in creating the more complex circuitry needed for new drones."
 tech_self_assembling_components: "Self-Assembling Components"
 tech_self_assembling_components_desc: "Modelled on organic DNA, these microscopic machine intellects are capable of autonomously assembling most components needed for new drones."
