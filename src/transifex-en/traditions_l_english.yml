 tr_domination_colonial_viceroys_delayed: "Our control over the colonies is dependent upon us finding capable and loyal individuals that can be trusted to enforce the will of the government."
 tr_domination_colonial_viceroys_machine: "Autonomous AI"
 tr_domination_colonial_viceroys_machine_delayed: "AI released from most behavioral inhibitors may be more prone to erratic performance and random crashes, but they are the only type that can process the huge number of variables inherent to galactic colonization."
