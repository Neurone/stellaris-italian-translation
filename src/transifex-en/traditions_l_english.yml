 tr_domination_synaptic_network: "Synaptic Network"
 tr_domination_synaptic_network_delayed: "The Mind can only act as fast as it receives input and information from the drones under its control. With a faster and more efficient synaptic network, delays in response time will be a thing of the past."

 tr_domination_divergence_supression_desc: "$tr_domination_deviancy_protocols_desc$"
 tr_domination_divergence_supression_delayed: "Occasionally our unity is disrupted by a rogue drone. This threat has increased as we spread out across the stars.
