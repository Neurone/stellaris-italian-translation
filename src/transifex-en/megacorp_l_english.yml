The MegaCorpse initiative was originally developed as a psionic strike force. They would \"play\" difficult \"venues,\" effectively subverting rebellious movements with overtly anti-corporate lyrics disguising subtle psionic aggression-dampening measures inflicted on the listener.\n\nUltimately, the catalytic effects of their music on the band's already-potent psionic powers soon proved too much for managers and executives to control.
