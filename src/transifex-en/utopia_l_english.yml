 utopia.2017.desc: "Building on what remains of the ruined Ring World in the [From.GetName] system, our engineers have managed to fully restore one of its sections. The new biosphere had to be created more or less from scratch by our leading planetologists, but it is now considered stable and ready for habitation."
 anomaly.2576.name: "A New Metal"
 anomaly.2576.desc: "Detailed surface scans of [From.GetName] have identified a large impact crater containing the wreckage of several ancient starships of unknown design. The ships appear to be completely devoid of life support systems, leading us to suspect that they were either unusually large drones or controlled by some form of artificial intelligence.\n\nInterestingly, the hull of the ships was constructed out of §HLiving Metal§!, an exceedingly rare and inorganic material with many unique properties. This metal can be \"programmed\" to assume a certain shape or form, and it will slowly regrow itself if damaged. Over a period of several millennia, the surviving metal from the wrecked ships was fused into a large and extremely dense deposit that could potentially be mined for centuries to come."
