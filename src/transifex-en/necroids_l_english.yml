To all onlookers, they would have seemed to be following a standard meandering course of development, with occasionally rapid periods of innovation interspersed with much longer periods of seemingly insurmountable setbacks. However, unbeknownst to them, their planet was home to a second intelligent species: us.\n\nFor millennia, we - the [GetSpeciesNamePlural] - remained undetected by the planet's proprietors. Little more than vague rumors of terrors in the night, we were a fairytale told only to scare misbehaving juveniles. But they were wrong to discount us.\n\nAs their rate of technological progress quickened, so too did our infiltration of their society."
 START_SCREEN_NECROPHAGE: "$START_SCREEN_NECROPHAGE_BASE$ When their fall came, it was swift and bloody. We ruthlessly took control of the planet - our precursors reduced to subservience and gradual absorption into the [GetSpeciesName] race.\n\nNow armed with the recently-discovered secret of FTL travel, we are ready to take to the stars and remake all species of the galaxy in our likeness!"
