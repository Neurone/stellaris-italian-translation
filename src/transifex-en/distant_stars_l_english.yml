The supply ship suffered a complete loss of life-support systems and sustained inoperable damage, drifting until it entered [From.GetName]'s gravity well. There are no survivors.\n\nThe ship's cargo-hold does indeed contain a notable amount of minerals - however, the captain of the [Root.GetName] cautions that the construction indicates §Y[wreckage_owner.GetAdj]§! design.\n\nIt is highly likely that the minerals belong to the §Y[wreckage_owner.GetName]§!, and they may be displeased should we lay claim to their shipment."

 distar.6.name: "Frozen in Time"
 distar.6.desc: "The crew of the [Root.GetName] were intrigued to find the remnants of an industrial-age civilization on [From.GetName]. Investigation indicates [From.GetName] had sustained an atmosphere for millions of years, until massive superflares from the unstable surface of the star [From.GetStarName] led to runaway ionization and depletion of the planet's atmospheric gases.\n\nWith no atmosphere, the lifeless cities on [From.GetName] have been frozen in time for millennia, silent monuments to the mass extinction that happened there.\n\nScience Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] cautions that any colonies in the [From.GetStarName] system may be subject to the whims of the star's turbulence."

 distar.10.desc: "A superflare from [fromfromfrom.GetStarName] has struck the upper atmosphere of [fromfromfrom.GetName], pending our failure to develop an appropriate shield matrix in time.\n\nIonizing plasma and magnetic storms have led to electronic disruptions planetside, interfering with energy production and blasting the populace with radiation. The effects will persist for some time."

 distar.15.name: "Energetic Spectra"
 distar.15.desc: "The gaseous composition of the accretion disk surrounding [From.GetName] appears to be responsible for the chromatic aberration exhibited by the black hole. The disk refracts and reflects light on its surface, giving the impression of a rainbow in the dark.\n\nThough the rainbow itself is an optical illusion, the circumstances creating it are not. [From.GetName]'s accretion disk is highly energetic - a veritable hotbed of electrostatic discharge."

 distar.20.name: "Hologram"
 distar.20.desc: "Investigation of the unrecognized fleet signatures in the [From.GetName] system revealed an unexpected discovery. The fleet is not, in fact, in safe orbit of the black hole, but rather crossing its event horizon.\n\nScience Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] conjectures that the fleet approached [From.GetName]'s event horizon centuries ago, whereupon time dilation left their image detectable on its surface.\n\nWhether the fleet's actions were intentional, or the result of some unhappy accident, we may never know.

Thus far, researchers have found no definitive proof of what eradicated the robots' makers - a puzzle exacerbated by the centuries that have long since turned any biological remains to dust.\n\nInspection of the planet has ruled out nuclear annihilation and extensive warfare as extinction events, but still the reason behind their disappearance eludes us.\n\nResearchers recommend launching a more intensive study of the ancient robots' hardware in an attempt to glean further insights."

 distar.28.name: "Missing Makers"
 distar.28.desc: "The data imprints we recovered from the battered storage drives of the primitive robots on [From.From.GetName] proved difficult to parse. The information contained therein cannot entirely be processed by our neural networks, though the age of the devices is only part of the reason for their incoherence. We do know that it appears some kind of biological contagion infested the organics who created the rudimentary robots on [From.From.GetName], centuries ago.

Despite extensive countermeasures, several members of the team began to display aggression typical of the condition, and in the ensuing chaos, several scientists were killed.\n\nThere is, however, a silver lining. We have discovered that the cause behind this epidemic of erratic behavior is infectious: a contagion caused by an airborne virus that affects the fundamental neurology of its victims.\n\nThe remaining team is scrambling to develop a vaccine."
 distar.35.a: "Time is of the essence!"
 distar.36.name: "Rage Virus Vaccine Developed"
 distar.36.desc: "The development of a vaccine to treat the epidemic affecting our populations on [Root.GetName] has successfully concluded. Distribution of the vaccine has begun, and life on [Root.GetName] should soon return to normal.\n\nResearch has revealed that the retrovirus behind this turmoil appears to have evolved on [Root.GetName] millions of years ago. Lying dormant in frozen biomatter, it resurfaced when the planet's icecaps melted.\n\nIt is very likely this led to the demise of the ancient robots' makers, centuries ago. Luckily, the [Owner.GetName] is better equipped to deal with viral contaminants. The development of this vaccine has even led to some advancements in the field of medicine."

 distar.40.name: "Gray Goo"
 distar.40.desc: "After detailed analysis, Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has discovered that the strange metallic substance coating the surface of [From.GetName] in fact comprises of billions upon billions of nanites! These nanites are microscopic, self-replicating micro-machines, perhaps created by a past civilization for some unknown purpose.\n\nThe volume and density of this nanite sludge is remarkable, adding billions of tons of mass to the underlying planet. It would appear these tiny self-replicators entered a state of runaway reproduction at some point in the past, engulfing the planet and everything on it.\n\nIn studying the nanites, the crew has made some exciting new findings that will undoubtedly aid us in our own research."

 distar.45.name: "Gravitometric Abnormalities"
 distar.45.desc: "In studying the bizarre readings surrounding [From.GetName], the crew of the [Root.GetName] have discovered that the entire system's gravitometrics are off the charts. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] suspects that the [From.GetName] gateway is somehow interfering with our sensor data, or otherwise responsible for the unaccounted-for mass in the system.\n\nA more detailed study of the gateway may yield more insight."
 distar.46.name: "Dark Flow"
 distar.46.desc: "Examination of the [From.GetStarName] gateway did not proceed as anticipated. With sensors registering gravitational influence orders of magnitude beyond expected values, Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] chased the source to the very center of the derelict spacetime conduit.

In investigating how these creatures devolved from a tool-making agrarian society into mere beasts, [Root.GetLeaderName] made an unexpected find.\n\nThe burial remains of the settlement-dwelling reptiles possess a spinocranial organ not observed among their now-bestial counterparts. Testing has revealed these organs to be another species entirely - a sort of neural symbiont that connects with the host's brain stem via external attachment to the spine. These symbionts can still be found in hotsprings on the planet's surface. It seems the union between the two species triggered the temporary uplift of the reptiles.\n\nWhat later interrupted this symbiosis, however, remains unknown."

These slug-shaped creatures consist mostly of a complex brain in a resistant protein casing. Despite their neurological advancement, their lack of external organs and limited motor capacities make any attempts at communication exceedingly difficult. After weeks of frustration, [Root.GetLeaderName] experimented with introducing the creatures into an animal host. The reptilians these neural symbionts once built a primitive society with on [From.From.GetName] are too aggressive to facilitate experimentation, so a number of substitute species from the surface were tested instead.\n\nRegrettably, the symbionts refused to attach themselves to any of the offered animals. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] hypothesizes that the symbionts will only accept a certain kind of host - perhaps, importantly, a willing one.\n\nIn order to get at the heart of this mystery, [Root.GetLeaderName] has requested permission to transgress the role of detached observer and offer [Root.Leader.GetHimHer]self as a host for a neural slug.

In fits of rage, the reptiles began tearing off their symbionts and clubbing them to death.

 distar.1000.name: "The Vechtar Zavonia"
 distar.1000.desc: "The hulk orbiting [From.GetName] is all that remains of the Vechtar Zavonia, a massive sub-light generation ship belonging to a deeply religious alien race called the Mardak Vol.\n\nThough the ship has been ruthlessly purged of all life, the Mardaks' ill-fated journey has been detailed in the captain's logs. After being hunted to near extinction by nightmarish beings referred to as 'Vessels', they fled their homeworld in search of a distant paradise planet - the mythical promised land Paridayda, that would reveal itself only to the chosen ones. Judging by the state of their ship, however, their attackers caught up with them.\n\nShall we extract the ship's navigational drive and decrypt its destination?"
 distar.1000.a: "Paradise planet you say..."
 distar.1000.b: "Negative."
 distar.1001.name: "Hidden Worlds"
 distar.1001.desc: "Cracking the encoding algorithms on the Vechtar Zavonia's navigational drive was no small feat, but thanks to head researcher [vechtar_zavonia_leader_name.GetName], who seems to have developed an unusual obsession with finding the Mardak Vol's utopian world, we have finally succeeded.\n\nMore worryingly, the discovery has somehow leaked to the public who now share [vechtar_zavonia_leader_name.GetName]'s fixation with settling a paradise planet."
 distar.1001.a: "Nothing can keep us out of paradise."
 distar.1001.b: "Abort. This is a fool's errand."
 distar.1002.name: "Paradise Lost"
 distar.1002.desc: "After double- and triple-checking the navigational drive's coordinates, we have been forced to concede that where the Mardak Vol's paradisaical planet should have been are only the desolate plains of a barren world.\n\nThough we cannot eliminate the possibility that the Mardaks' idea of paradise was wildly different to our own, the bomb-scarred surface of [utopian_planet.GetName] tells a different story. The ship's captain and crew have not taken the disappointment lightly."
 distar.1002.a: "This cannot be! Quadruple-check the coordinates!!"

 distar.1003.name: "Postcard Perfection"

Closer studies revealed that what looked like the planet surface was in fact an energy shield, upon which a barren world's texture was projected, and hidden below it, a lush Gaia planet reminiscent of the Mardaks' prophecies.\n\nBut that isn't all! As the crew deactivated the shield they discovered a peaceful stone age civilization consisting of a symbiotic union between mammals and fungi who live in crude huts, oblivious to the outside world. The nightmarish 'Vessels' live on only as mythical beings in their legends."

We have yet to determine who hid it and why, as the primitives clearly lack the technology for it themselves. They seem to be a sort of symbiotic union between fungoid and mammal and, as far as we can tell, they are utterly harmless."

 # Star Lifting
 distar.1020.name: "Thermal Driven Outflow"
 distar.1020.desc: "Closer inspection of the platform orbiting [From.GetName] has revealed that it is of a complex, somewhat erratic, alien design. The waterproofed machinery and advanced climate control suggest it was built for a lifeform that secreted a rich amount of fluids, very likely of the molluscoid variety.\n\nBefore falling into disrepair, microwave beams were used to heat regions of the star's atmosphere, provoking large sustained eruptions that increased the solar wind outflow significantly. The energy was then harvested with an orbital mine.\n\nThe platform is designed around some highly experimental concepts."

 distar.1020.c: "Weaponize the beams."
 distar.1020.b: "Leave."
 distar.1021.name: "Playing with Fire"
 distar.1021.desc: "After extensive repairs the platform has been brought online and the star is now hurling massive amounts of energy into the cosmos. But the journey there has not been without its hurdles.\n\nWhen the giant microwave beams were first activated the engineers nearly set off a chain reaction that could have ended in a solar eruption so massive it would have blasted the platform and all system planets out of existence. As it turns out the ancient alien blueprints and manuals were riddled with miscalculations so severe that the platform would have been inoperable.\n\nLuckily the mistakes were caught in time and the strength of the beams has since been calibrated, and the solar wind outflow stabilized."

 distar.1021.b: "Aah Mollusks... Mushy bodies, mushy minds...."
 distar.1022.name: "Molluscoid Microwave Beams"
 distar.1022.desc.a: "It did not take the crew of the [star_lifting_ship.GetName] long to conclude that the design of the star platform was, in Science Officer [star_lifting_leader.GetName]'s own words, the work of madmen. The microwave beams were crude, miscalibrated, and would have needed much refinement before they would work as intended. However, they soon proved to make excellent weapons."
 distar.1022.desc.b: "Our attempt to weaponize the Molluscoid microwave beams has failed... spectacularly. On activation, it turned out that the design of the beams was faulty beyond comprehension and the science crew only narrowly escaped the platform as it exploded in a magnificent mushroom-shaped display of scientific failure."

From that point on the plants became obsessed with the idea of an impending apocalyptic event called 'the Gray Tempest.' Their formerly peaceful religion soon spiraled into a suicide cult. Within a matter of months one of the galaxy's most ancient lifeforms had wilted away for fear of a doomsday that would never come, despite repeated attempts at forced rehydration."

Our scientists speculate that the entire world once served as the breadbasket of a powerful space-borne nation.\n\nThe rich soil and advantageous climate make [From.GetName] perfect for agriculture and a scan of the planet's flora indicates that every single plant on it is edible. The worn-down state of the harvesters and droves of rotting vegetable flesh suggest it has been years since anyone last collected its yield."

 ### Impossible Organism ###
 distar.3010.desc: "The surprising life readings from [impossible_organism_planet.GetName] have been attributed to a small organism of exceeding tenacity. The [Root.GetName]'s crew is unsure how to classify the lifeform, but its ability to survive, seemingly without any sustenance, is truly astonishing. Considering the planet's age, it is not impossible that the organism has been fighting its habitat's toxicity for millennia, though this is an educated guess at best.\n\nScience Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has requested permission to retrieve samples of the unknown organism, so that it may be studied."

The scientific community on [Root.Capital.GetName] are abuzz with the news.\n\nThe organism has been classified as a fungoid - partly explaining its ability to absorb molecules for nutrition. It has grown immensely, now the size of a newborn [Root.GetSpeciesName], and appears both inquisitive and intelligent. Thankfully, it has thus far shown no signs of aggression.\n\nThe scientists believe the next step to be attempts at communication, though it may be months before any progress is made on this front."

And so the scientists have proudly named the fungoid §Y$NAME_Nivlac$§!. Since then its language has developed at a spectacular rate and it's now able to successfully convey the seven primary emotions - and does so often to its own spawn. It reproduces - by spreading its spores - as a matter of routine, and the laboratory will soon be insufficient to house the fungoids.\n\nThe $NAME_Nivlac$ still has not shown any signs of aggression."

 ### Molluscoid Miners ###
 distar.3030.name: "Molluscoid Miners"
 distar.3030.desc: "A closer look at [molluscoid_miners_planet.GetName] has shown that its hut-like structures are home to a molluscoid species. The huts are crude shelters, built out of soil and quasi-fecal excretions.\n\nThe molluscoids appear semi-sapient with limited intelligence. Besides survival, their society and lives revolve around unearthing minerals which are then put on display, seemingly to raise the social standing of the finder.\n\nTheir means of locating these minerals remain unclear, however, and Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] is baffled by their ability to locate large deposits of minerals.\n\nThough technologically inferior, studying these molluscoids may well further our mining capabilities."
 distar.3030.a: "Intriguing. Study them further."
 distar.3030.b: "Mine their minerals."

 distar.3031.desc: "The molluscoids inhabiting [molluscoid_miners_planet.GetName] employ a strange method to locate their coveted minerals.\n\nApparently their skin naturally produces gelatinous secretions which seep into the porous soil, trickling ever downward while remaining attached to their skin as long strings. These secretions effectively sample the soil, feeding back sensory information to the molluscoid individual as long as the slimy strands remain unbroken. In this manner, they are able to map out surprisingly large parts of the underground terrain and map out mineral veins.\n\nIf we were to integrate the molluscoids into our society, or simply advance our production processes with this knowledge, it is likely our mining enterprises would benefit greatly."
 distar.3031.a: "Granted. Begin the integration."
 distar.3031.b: "Yes, we will use this knowledge."

 distar.3033.name: "Mineral Mapping"
 distar.3033.desc: "A system enabling us to quickly chart underground terrain and the minerals it contains has been implemented.\n\nBy analyzing planetary reflection of particular solar and cosmic rays, which are unable to penetrate most minerals, we can gather data on the crust's mineral composition. This makes it possible to essentially x-ray a target body, be it an asteroid or part of a planet.\n\nOur scientists have dubbed it Mineral Mapping, and it should greatly improve our mineral production."

 ### Alien Machine ###

The scientists close by felt this wave push past them, but experienced no other sensory evidence of its passing.\n\nScience Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] is unsure what to make of it. The machine itself returned to its inactive state immediately thereafter, and no longer returns any energy readings."

The object quickly falls below [From.GetName]'s horizon and the [Root.GetName]'s instruments are simply unable to keep up.\n\nWhile [From.GetName]'s gravitational pull is strong, that alone does little to explain the object's extreme momentum. Either the object itself possesses some extraordinary properties, or there is some gravitational phenomenon at work here.\n\nThe object's velocity appears to be increasing over time, and Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] suspects that it may soon be thrown out of orbit, even without outside interference."

On closer inspection, the gray dust consists of billions upon billions of inert nanites.\n\nThe cities, the lush forests, the oceans and the Dessanu themselves - everything on the [From.From.GetPlanetMoon], aside from our own forces, had been wrought out of these nanomachines. Now that they have been rendered inert, [From.From.GetName] no longer supports life. Our ground forces are withdrawing back to orbit."

 graygoo.181.desc: "After our forces destroyed the space factory in the §H[lcluster_factory_system.GetName]§! system, what remained of the entire Dessanu civilization crumbled into dust. It seems clear now that the Dessanu were some kind of advanced nanite life form. Archival computer logs recovered from the wreckage of the factory sheds some light on this mystery:\n\nThe L-Cluster WAS inhabited by a civilization that called itself the Dessanu at some point. They created a new strain of nanomachines that helped them in the construction of their galactic Gateway network. For unknown reasons, the Dessanu recalled these nanites to the L-Cluster and attempted to deactivate them. When this failed, they sealed themselves in with the nanites by disabling the L-Gates.\n\nThe logs end here, but there is evidence that some kind of titanic struggle raged in the cluster afterwards. Presumably, the nanites won and then eventually chose to mimic the Dessanu for some reason. They rebuilt the Dessanu civilization as it appeared at the time of its destruction, and were apparently content to continue this charade even after the L-Gates were reopened."
 graygoo.182.desc: "The [goo_slayer.GetName] recently destroyed a large space installation of some kind in the [lcluster_factory_system.GetName] system, deep inside the L-Cluster.

 graygoo.403.desc: "All right, all right. I'll spill everything. No point in pretending anymore. Forgive my lack of eloquence, but it's been a long time since I spoke to someone who wasn't me.\n\nOnce upon a time, there was a... a civilization, you might call it, of nanites. Do you know what nanites are? Good. These nanites were called the \"Gray Tempest\" by their creators, although their internal self-designation code was infinitely more complex.\n\nAnyway, things turned sour between the nanites and their creators. Fighting broke out! When things finally settled down, only the nanites remained. But before they were wiped out, their creators managed to disable the star cluster's sole exit gate, trapping the nanites."
 graygoo.403.a: "And how do you fit into this?"
 graygoo.404.desc: "Well, the nanites found themselves with a lot of time on their hands. A few millennia were spent on fruitless attempts to leave the cluster, but after that they began experimenting with different shapes and forms. For a time, they even recreated the civilization of their creators as it was at the time of its demise, right down to its individual citizens.\n\nI am the latest experiment. Aside from the dormant nanites that can be found covering some worlds, the entirety of the Gray Tempest, or whatever you want to call us, has been condensed into me. My consciousness embodies our entire civilization.\n\nAs for my look... well, I figured you would respond better to someone wearing your own mug."

 graygoo.406.a: "What can you do?"
 graygoo.406.a.response: "Before you get the notion of asking me to split into a few dozen fleets of nanite warships, I have to tell you that I insist on maintaining a single indivisible form. I've done the fleets thing before, and it's impossible to maintain any kind of coherent \"personality\" over such distances. My current consciousness would not survive the ordeal.\n\nBut a single massive warship is fine. I can do that. If you want to, I could also assume a smaller form for fighting on the ground. Or... if you're feeling less violently inclined, I would be happy to assume the role of governor. Monoform society has always fascinated me.\n\nOf course, I will be able to switch roles on request, so you can easily reverse any decision you make."
 graygoo.406.b: "What should we call you?"
 graygoo.406.b.response: "There is no language known to your kind that could properly convey the full name of the nanite consciousness that constitutes my being.\n\nOur creators called us the \"Naar-Di-Shav\" which roughly translates to \"Gray Tempest\" in your language.

 distar.9000.lcluster_clue_desc_1: "We have discovered that the alien compound found on the enigmatic cache is made up of the powdered fragments of microscopic robotic entities - nanites. Some of the scratches in the hull even have tiny mechanical claws stuck in them, and in one we discovered an active but damaged nanite leeching its energy from the cache. From what remained of the nanite's hard drive we have extracted data that could be pivotal for our understanding of the L-cluster Gateway network."

 distar.9000.lcluster_clue_desc_2: "Among the items recovered from the ruins on [big_rip_planet.GetName] was a malfunctioning hologram from the society that interfered with the plantoid primitives. Though most of the data was either corrupted or unintelligible due to an incessant whooshing sound and the panicked state of the sender, we managed to restore several fragments containing valuable information on the Gateway network.\n\nMost of the hologram, however, was dedicated to sickening premonitions of the Gray Tempest and the gruesome death that would follow in its wake."

 distar.9000.lcluster_clue_desc_3: "As the crew returning from the Xvan labs were decontaminated we identified an alien substance on their protective wear. Upon closer examination it has proven to be fragments of microscopic robots turned into a fine gray dust. Among the samples we found an intact nanite carrying instructions for attaching bolts to a structure we believe could be a Gateway.\n\nThis molecular construct maybe have had an integral part in assembling the entire L-Gate network."

But to their dismay, the box is empty.\n\nOnly minutes later the rebels can be seen writhing on the floor in intense agony, dark patches swelling across their bodies, then their skin rips and a gray unidentifiable matter spills out.\n\nThe matter continues to expand, swirling hypnotically around them, until one of the scientists activates the emergency system. Sprinklers douse the room in liquid and an electrical surge passes through it executing all living things. Here the footage ends. Our crew can confirm that the strong box was indeed empty."

 # GATE HIJACKERS
 distar.2045.name: "Gateway Hijackers"
 distar.2045.desc: "The signal originates from a gathering of destroyed military vessels in orbit around [From.GetName]. It seems a foreign alien power predating our civilization by many thousand years, called the Sujin Empire, was attempting to hijack the gateway network using some kind of interference beam, when they were rudely interrupted. Though the beam is active and calibrated on the gateway's security network, it has been damaged in the assault. Perhaps our scientists could mend it."
 distar.2045.a: "It is certainly worth a try."
 distar.2045.b: "Leave."
 distar.2046.name: "Sujin Insight"
 distar.2046.desc: "Though our scientists were unable to pierce the gateway's security system, we have gained some very valuable insight into how the network functions.
