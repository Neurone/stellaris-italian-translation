 utopia.1.name: "A Request for the [ringworld_builder.GetName]"
 utopia.1.desc.v1: "Some of our intelligence assets have uncovered data suggesting that the [ringworld_builder.GetName]'s ring world could be hiding a secret launch platform for weapons of mass destruction. Though the validity of the source has yet to be confirmed, the notion has taken hold with the public who demand that we take action. Surely if the [ringworld_builder.GetName] has nothing to hide, they will allow a team of our weapons experts to inspect the site."
 utopia.1.desc.v2: "Since the [ringworld_builder.GetName] started construction on a ring world, several of our leading engineers have been following the project from afar, and are greatly impressed with their progress. They believe we could learn from studying their craftsmanship closer, and suggest that we ask their permission to station a research team on location."
 utopia.1.desc.v4: "Lately prophets across the empire have been plagued by horrific visions of death and destruction, tied to the appearance of a great circular object in the sky. Putting two and two together, our religious leaders are worried that the [ringworld_builder.GetName]'s ambition to build a ring world has angered the gods, and advise us to send a delegation to consecrate the project, before it's too late."
 utopia.1.a: "Forward our request to the [ringworld_builder.GetName]."

Either way we should handle the situation delicately."

The engineering chief has organized to send a delegation of our finest engineers there shortly, to report on the construction process."
 utopia.3.desc.v4: "The [From.GetName] welcomes our efforts to align with a higher presence, and promises to halt all construction on the ring world till our religious leaders are satisfied that it won't interfere with divine will.\n\nA handful of chosen officials are setting out for the construction site immediately, to ensure that the grim prophecy is never fulfilled."

Despite some initial misunderstandings due to cultural differences, both teams were satisfied with the exchange and have learned much from each other."
 utopia.5.desc.v4: "The religious officials sent to consecrate the [From.GetName]'s ring world, have returned from their mission with more questions than answers. As they meditated on the construction platform, they entered a deep divinatory trance, and discovered that the ring world is not the cause of the visions after all. Though unable to decipher the true meaning of the visions, they reassure us that \"what may be, may never be...\""

 utopia.22.desc: "The construction team on the ring world has discovered a large deposit of minerals embedded in extremely porous stone, that will disintegrate during the build process. Though sensitive, the sample could be valuable enough that it would be worth our while to halt construction to extract it."

 utopia.22.b: "We can't delay construction."
 utopia.27.name: "Missing Workers"
 utopia.27.desc: "Since construction on the ring world began, a number of workers have gone missing. Though it's likely they've simply left with one of the many transports without notifying their supervisors, we are launching an investigation into their whereabouts. Sadly their unexpected departure has delayed construction slightly."

 utopia.23.name: "Ring World Pets"
 utopia.23.desc: "It appears as if one of the planets used to construct the ring world was not as uninhabited as we first thought. A seemingly harmless, but previously unknown species of giant space worm, nicknamed \"Coo-coo\" after its call, has been transferred to the ring world with fragments from its homeworld.\n\nWith their fuzzy fur and gentle demeanor, the endearing creatures have become an instant favorite with the workers, who are far away from their families and often very lonely. Especially in the light of their missing co-workers.\n\nWe could allow the creatures to continue their lives in peace, or purge them, delaying construction slightly."
#utopia.23.desc.v2: "One of the planets used to construct the ring world was not as uninhabited as we first thought. A seemingly harmless species of worm lives on the ring world. We could halt construction to remove them or allow them to continue their lives in peace. Our xenophile pops want to spare them."
 utopia.23.a: "Exterminate them."
 utopia.23.b: "Better not disturb them."
 utopia.25.name: "A Shocking Revelation"
 utopia.25.desc: "To everyone's amazement, the ring world has erupted into a flurry of color as thousands of space worms, or as it seems, larvae, are transforming into butterflies. Likely the change has been brought on by the generation of an atmosphere.\n\nUnfortunately, celebrations have been cut short by the discovery of a subterranean network of tunnels, in which Coo-coos were caught feeding off the remains of several missing workers.\n\nConstruction has been halted till the creatures have been exterminated, but we expect swift results as the workers are highly motivated. The true nature of the Coo-coo has been revealed."
 utopia.25.a: "Good riddance."
 utopia.26.name: "A Shocking Revelation"
 utopia.26.desc: "The extermination team's efforts to rid the ring world of the giant space worms known as Coo-coos, have been aggravated by violent protests from the construction workers.\n\nIn a desperate attempt to hide his pet, one young man even ventured far enough outside the build site, that he stumbled upon a subterranean network of freshly dug tunnels, where he caught several Coo-coos feeding off the remains of his missing co-workers. After narrowly escaping from his beloved pet, as it tried to spray him with digestive fluids, he alerted the extermination team, which has made short work of the carnivorous worms.\n\nAnd so the true nature of the Coo-coo has finally been revealed."

 utopia.30.name: "The One-Eyed Wanderer"
 utopia.30.desc.v1: "Our empire has been shaken by the discovery that the [dysonsphere_builder.GetName] are building a Dyson Sphere around [dyson_system.GetName], a central star in one of our most beloved constellations, the \"One-eyed Wanderer,\" completely blocking its light.\n\nThe Wanderer, with her single eye, has watched over our kind since the beginning of time, and legend has it that she guides not only our fleets, but the stars themselves in their journey across the sky.
