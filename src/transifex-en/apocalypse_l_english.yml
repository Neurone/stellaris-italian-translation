 apoc.100.desc.pacif: "With deterrence theory once again in vogue among leading political scientists on [Root.Capital.GetName], the Colossus Project is presented as the ultimate deterrent; a weapon to surpass even the Titan ship class. While the proposed Colossus ships could carry payloads capable of complete planetary annihilation, we will deploy them using a less violent - but nevertheless terrifyingly permanent - method of conflict resolution.\n\nIf a hypothetical enemy will not cease their aggression toward us or our allies, we must simply §Rmake them§!."
 apoc.100.desc.milit: "Previously spoken of only in hushed voices, and before then only in whispers in the most labyrinthine corridors of military skunkworks facilities, the Colossus Project now enjoys official sanction. Possibly the single greatest military innovation the galaxy will ever see, the Colossus Project comprises the development of a §RPlanet-Killer§! weapons platform as well as a Colossus hull configuration to carry it. The Colossus vessels will likely require an escort as the projected demands of a Planet-Killer weapon preclude any other armament.\n\nNevertheless, the Colossus, once developed, promises to be perhaps the single most destructive force in the galaxy."
 apoc.100.desc.phobe: "The Colossus Project is being hailed as the single most important advancement in the ongoing struggle against the wretched aliens that plague the galaxy. As designed, a Colossus ship is a gargantuan, heavily armored frame fitted with a lone §RPlanet-Killer§!-class weapon. Its ability to simply wipe the galaxy clean of planets that will not submit to us will certainly prove invaluable, as the xeno threat is far from over."

 apoc.1.name: "Abandoned Gateway"
 apoc.1.desc: "An ancient space station of some kind has been located at the edge of the [gateway_system.GetName] system. The strong residual subspace signature that surrounds the station indicates that it may be a \"§HGateway§!\" of sorts - part of a theoretical network of similar stations that at some point would have allowed for near-instantaneous travel between different parts of the galaxy.\n\nAssuming this is a Gateway, its current state of disrepair has rendered it unusable. If it could be restored into working order, its owner would potentially be able to access any other functional gateways in the galaxy, enabling travel across huge distances in a matter of days."
 apoc.2.desc: "We have encountered another abandoned Gateway, this time in the [gateway_system.GetName] system. Just like the first one, this Gateway is also currently inoperable due to its poor condition."
 apoc.3.desc: "We have located what we believe could be an ancient subspace Gateway near §H[gateway_system.GetName]§!. It appears to have been part of a galaxywide network of similar stations which, when operational, allowed for near-instantaneous travel from one part of the galaxy to another.\n\nAt some point after its initial construction its connection to the rest of the network was severed. It now offers only one valid destination - an uncharted group of stars just beyond our galaxy that our astronomers have designated the §HL-Cluster§!. Even more intriguing, the Gateway was built entirely by microscopic §HNanites§! of an unknown design.\n\nAlthough the Gateway emits a faint power signature, it has been deliberately locked into some kind of maintenance loop that prevents its activation. Until we find some way of aborting this process, the L-Cluster will remain beyond our reach."
