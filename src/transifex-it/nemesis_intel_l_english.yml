 first_contact_critters.65.desc: "Although we have been unable to establish communications with them - mainly because they are unwilling to communicate with us - we have been able to identify the §H[This.ContactCountry.GetName]§! as pirates. Visual indicators point to their culture being largely spaceborne, and some phenotypes observed among them match no known planet-dwelling civilizations.\n\nUnfortunately, their crews are completely uninterested in civil discourse. What little we have been able to glean from intercepting intra-fleet communications indicate that they primarily subsist on piracy, occasionally recruiting fringe elements of spacefaring civilizations to their cause."

They have not made any hostile moves, nor is there any heavy weaponry in evidence. However, they have been fairly closed-mouthed, and we have been unable to pick up many signals from them. Our [This.Owner.GetLinguists] are confident that they will be able to translate their language eventually from the scraps we pick up. However, this may take quite some time."
