Greetings!

Stellaris has been updated!

The galaxy is now a more mysterious place - Intel such as full borders or details about governments are now hidden until revealed by a Spy Network, sufficient Trust, or through intelligence sharing from Diplomatic Pacts. Envoys can be assigned to manage Spy Networks in the diplomatic screen, and they have also taken over a greatly expanded First Contact system.

Colonies now produce Alloys and Consumer Goods using Industrial Districts, and several buildings have new effects that add additional jobs to certain districts. Planetary designations can be used to specialize Industrial District production towards either Alloys or Consumer Goods, and improvements have been made on colony and sector automation.

Building Slots are now opened up by expanding the infrastructure of the colony by building City Districts or upgrading the colony's capital building.

Biological pop growth now follows a curve where their growth accelerates on partially filled planets, but slows as the planet becomes crowded. All pops (including assembled ones) now require progressively more growth to create, greatly reducing the overall number in the late game.
